# basePowerProblem
A solution to the challenge of representing any given number as ' basepower + remainder' in C++


## The problem was set as:
Requirements:

1. Takes two inputs one is the base number and the second one is the number to be
represented in basepower + remainder format. For example if the user enters 3 as base
number and 36 as the number the output should be “36 = 33 + 9”.

2. The program should check the given number should be greater than the base number. If
not it shout output an error msg.

3. It should also check the base number is greater than 1.

4. Bonus requirement: The program should check if the remainder is divisible by the
base if so it should output remainder as base * (remainder/base). For example for base
3 and number 36 the program output should be “36 = 33 + (3 * 3)
